        I&apos;ve been interested in origami for a while now, and I&apos;ve been
        trying to learn it for a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all started with a notebook I bought. A classmate notebook that had
        origami papers and instructions in it to create bookmarks. I was
        fascinated by the idea of folding paper into shapes.

        I&apos;ve been trying to learn it for a while now. I&apos;ve been
        following tutorials on YouTube and practicing on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I will share my journey of learning origami and resources I have
        used to learn it.
